Inside the main function, a while loop alternates between the player and computers turn. Each player has a function to make their move. When itâ€™s the player's turn, the program will ask the user to input a column letter to make their move. Once this is made, an updated board will be shown. The computer will make its move and the board will be updated again. This keeps happening until there is either a winner or a tie. This is checked by the getScore function which gives us the winner of a specific game state or if there is a tie. The computer makes its move by getting the offensive and defensive score of each possible game state. We use these numbers to get a total score for each column which allows us to get the best move to either win or block a connect four. There are no global variables in this program as they are all passed as arguments in functions. This makes the code easier to read and utilizes functions for modularity. Each function also has a specific purpose for code reusability and makes it simpler to understand. All possible errors are accounted for as the program will keep asking for a valid input if an invalid one is entered. Examples of this is if the column is full or if the input is not a valid column letter.
